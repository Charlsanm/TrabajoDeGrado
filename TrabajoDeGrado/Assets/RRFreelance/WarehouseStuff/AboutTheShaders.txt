Standard Shaders

Base Shader:
Base Tint - The colour the Albedo should be multiplied by. By Default this is white so that the Albedo shows correctly.
Albedo - The main colour texture
ORM - Channel Packed (Ambient occlusion (RED), Roughness (GREEN), Metalness (BLUE) )
ToggleRoughnessToGloss - Checked by default to convert the Roughness to Gloss (inverts the values)
AO_Power - The strength of the AO
Metalness Adjust -  Add or subtract metalness from the metalness texture (ORM)
Gloss Adjust - Add or subtract gloss from the glossyness (/roughness to gloss) texture (ORM)
AO_IntoAlbedo - forces the AO to show up more in the base texture colour to enhance AO shadows.
Emissive - Self-illumination from the final colouring and texture.
Normal Map - A normal map, make sure it is marked as normal map in the project.
Normal Map Power - The strength of the normal map.
Flip Green? - Whether to invert the Green channel of the normal map if it was used for UnrealEngine for example.


Extended Shader.

Custom Colouring:

PreAdd - How much to add to the Base texture before splitting into the Low(Black) and High(White) tones.
PreSelfMultiply - How much to self-Multiply by before splitting into the Low(Black) and High(White) tones.
UpColour - A colour that always lands on the top of the mesh not matter the angle.
High Colour - the colour of the High tones
Low Colour - the colour of the Low tones
UpColourNoiseScale - Extra noise scale.
UpColourNoisePower - Noise Power
UpColourRange - How much to cover with the Up Colour
UpColourAmount - The overall amount of the Up colour


URP and HDRP
Please note, shaders are provided and will flag up as issues only when used in the wrong render pipeline, they may show as failed to compile.
To use the URP or HDRP shaders simply change the shader type of the materials. Again, make sure you are in the correct render pipeline. If
you need help with this, please get in touch and I will be happy to help. me@robertramsay.co.uk
